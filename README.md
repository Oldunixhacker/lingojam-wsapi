# Web Speech API Voice Generator

You want text to speech? **Here's basic text to speech!**

The Web Speech API can generate basic voice in a web page, like this one, through JavaScript.

Those AI voices aren't accurate. eSpeak-NG is used in several screen readers and can generate more accurate TTS.

This uses the Web Speech API to generate audio and list voices. This is the source code. The translator can be found at https://lingojam.com/WSAPI
